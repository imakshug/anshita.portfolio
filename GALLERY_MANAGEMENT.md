This guide explains how to add, update, and manage photos in your gallery section.

2. **Follow the instructions** in the admin panel for step-by-step guidance
3. **Use the template** provided to format your photo data correctly

### How It Works

The gallery loads photos from a JSON file located at `public/gallery/photos.json`. When you update this file and commit the changes to GitHub, your website automatically updates within 2-3 minutes.

2. Navigate to `public/gallery/` folder
3. Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Upload files"
4. Upload your images (JPG recommended for smaller file sizes)
5. Use descriptive filenames without spaces (e.g., `sunset-portrait.jpg`)

#### Step 2: Update Photo Data
1. Download the current `photos.json` file using the admin panel
2. Open it in any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)
3. Add your new photo information using the template format
4. Upload the updated `photos.json` file back to the `public/gallery/` folder

#### Step 3: Commit Changes
1. Add a commit message like "Add new photos"
2. Click "Commit changes"
3. Your website updates automatically!

### Photo Data Format

Each photo needs these fields:
- **id**: Unique number (increment from the last photo)
